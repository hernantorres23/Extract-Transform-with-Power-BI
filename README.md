Looking for the best choice I decided to test Power BI to try to make the same process made with Python.
  

For best understanding, please see my other repository in https://github.com/hernantorres23/ETL-with-Python.
  

At this time only can perform Extract and Transform, but the best thing was that I can use a graphical interface to M language
 and less code.
  

Depending on your requirements maybe you could use this way when you don't need to load the information in another system.  



That's all but remember that if you need some help write me an email at mikelerp@mail.ru
